                <p>
                    The first Battle Royale game could be traced back to a fanmade game in <i>Minecraft</i> called <i>Minecraft Survival Games</i>. 
                    This was a <i>Minecraft</i> spin-off to the popular novel: <i>The Hunger Games</i>. Its popularity among players would inspire 
                    modders to create battle royale mods for other video games. This would eventually lead to the creation of a game called <i>Player 
                    Unknown's Battlegrounds</i>. This game was a phenomenal success and would inspire a generation of battle royale games. <i>Player 
                    Unknown's Battlegrounds</i> would receive millions of daily players until it was challenged by a new battle royale. The addition
                    of a battle royale mode to <i>Epic Games' Fortnite</i> proved to be a massive success, even succeeding <i>Player Unknown's Battlegrounds</i> 
                    in popularity. This brings us to the present, where many companies are attempting to "cash out" on the battle royale genre's success.
                    There have been many battle royale games released since <i>Fortnite: Battle Royale</i>'s success. However, none of these games have been
                    popular enough to succeed the two big battle royale games mentioned. Instead, the quality of these games seem lower than their actual potential
                    and the slew of battle royale knockoffs on the <i>App Store</i> and <i>Google Play Store</i> are even worse in terms of quality. 
                    It seems as though the current market is only focused on profits instead of quality.
