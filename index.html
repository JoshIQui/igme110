                    The Video Game Crash of 1983 was a massive failure for the video game market. It brought about disaster to the genre of entertainment
                    and almost killed it entirely. The Battle Royale genre of video games shares many similarities with the events leading to the video game
                    crash of 1983. I propose that if the Battle Royale craze were to increase in another wave, it could bring about events that could cause
                    the entire genre to crash. Throughout this site, I will publish evidence and facts to allow you to draw your own conclusions about the
                    similarities the two forms of entertainment share.
